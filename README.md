# Frontend Mentor - Results summary component

![Design preview for the Results summary component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking my front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help me improve my coding skills by building realistic projects.



## The challenge

My challenge is to build out this results summary component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I can use any tools i like to help me complete the challenge.

I should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
